*Course hashtag: #DHRPG*

## Syllabus
The [course syllabus](dlcl205syllabus.md) will probably be revised somewhat as the course progresses.

## DH RPG
A simulation of a year in the life of a DH project -- done in tabletop RPG style (think *Dungeons and Dragons*) -- is a cornerstone of this course, but could also be adapted for other courses, workshops, and circumstances. All materials (handouts, templates, skill guides, etc.) will be posted here as they're used in class, and will be revised throughout the quarter in response to issues that arise during gameplay.

## DH RPG acknowledgements
Thanks to John Ayliff , Katia Bowers, James Cummings, Karin Dalziel, Jessica Dusasult, Rikk Mulligan, and Alex Wermer-Colan for their feedback on the first draft of the DH RPG.

Thanks to Mark Algee-Hewitt, Amanda Wilson Bergado, Melissa Hosek, and Camille Villa for their intrepid play-testing of the DH RPG.

The DH RPG is directly adapted from the 1980's and 1990's [original *Star Wars* D6 RPG by West End Games](http://www.starwarstimeline.net/Westendgames.htm). This whole project never would have happened were it not for my childhood best friend and co-adventurer Ali Lane, and her (in retrospect) incredibly patient and generous game master older brother, Sam Lane.
