# Getting Started with the DH RPG
 
## How this works
You’ll be playing a character who is part of a digital humanities project. While playing, you pretend to be that character.
 
The instructor will be the DM (DH Master). The DM acts as storyteller and referee, describing the scene to you and the other players. Imagine how your character would react to the situation (and discuss it with your colleagues, if a group of players are playing the same character), and tell the DM what your character is going to do.
 
When you describe what your character does, the DM will tell you when to roll the dice, and what happens as a result of how well (or poorly) you roll. In addition to rolling dice in order to take action, the DM may ask you to talk things through – in character – with the other characters in the game. In a way, you, the other players, and the DM are experiencing some of what it’s like to do a digital humanities project, without ever turning on a computer.
 
## Timeframe
We’ll play through a year in the life of a DH project, starting in the summer and running through the end of the next academic year. The project has received grant funding a few months before, giving the PI enough time to assemble the team of characters who start the game. In each class session, we’ll aim to play through two months of “game time”.
 
## Time (activity points) vs. skill (dice)
In the DH RPG, you work with the concepts of time and skill. For each month, every character gets an identical allotment of 20 activity points, which are used as a proxy for how your character spends their time; we all get 24 hours in the day. Many of the activities that you choose for your character can be performed well or badly, depending on your character’s skill (and luck). For those activities, you’ll roll dice corresponding to your character’s skill level with that activity to determine how successful the activity was.
 
In this version of the DH RPG, characters receive an activity point allotment that assumes they are sleeping around 6-7 hours per night. Players can negotiate with the DM for additional activity points in exchange for a penalty on their dice rolls. The penalty will get steeper the more times you do this; spending activity points on sleep will reduce the penalty.
 
## Winning
In principle, *everyone* can “win” the DH RPG! Each character has 1-2 individual goals that they need to complete in addition to the project goals. Because the project goals have to be met for anyone to win the game, working together is essential.
 

## Imagination and empathy
Imagination and empathy are at the heart of the DH RPG. For the RPG to be a meaningful simulation of a real DH project, you should use your imagination to try to embody the worldview of your character and make decisions that they would make within that worldview. (If you’re a tenure-track faculty member playing an undergrad, your character isn’t going to have the same time-management skills that you personally have.) At the same time, resist the temptation to descend into an exaggerated parody of your character type: you’re playing a person, not a stereotype. (Librarians live more complex lives than ordering books and going home to their cats.)
 
For purposes of this class, all players must play in good faith: you are actually trying to accomplish your character goals and the project goals, and shouldn’t actively take malicious steps to sabotage the project or others’ goals. At the same time, it may be realistic for your character to struggle with their goals and/or the project at some points in the game. Your character may have to deal with a family crisis (that you may declare as the player, or the DM may initiate as the result of a catastrophic Randomness roll), or stop working on the project for a month to manage the impact of budget cuts on their primary job. In the real world, team members have all kinds of reactions to these sorts of situations, shaped by their own background, experience, and disposition. In the DH RPG as played in this class, empathy will be our lodestar. Players should modulate their characters’ reactions with empathy to the extent possible. In this way, we play the world of DH not as it is, but as we’d like to see it.
 
## Other concepts
 
### Getting work done
Work gets done in the DH RPG through a combination of the decision to allocate time to it (spending activity points) + the character’s skill at doing the task. Typically, the number of activity points spent on the activity, plus the outcome of the roll, are subtracted from the total points required to complete the task. But if the player gets “snake eyes” (more than one die with 1), the character has screwed up and neither the activity points nor the roll count towards the task. (If the character has only 1D in the skill and they get a 1, they get no points and have to roll the randomness die.) 

### Randomness die
When you roll, one die will be a different color. If you get a 1 on that die, you’ll have to roll a 12-sided die to determine how good (high numbers) or low (bad numbers) the random event will be. The DM will choose an event that corresponds to your roll.
 
### Power & Goodwill
If your character has dealings with a character type with a lower place in the university hierarchy, they can optionally use Power for a bonus on Interpersonal and Management activities (except Listening and Empathy). Using Power generates negative Goodwill points with the other character; using it on behalf of another character generates positive Goodwill. Goodwill works as a modifier (positive or negative) on future interactions with the character in question.
