Project Management and Ethical Collaboration for Humanists

Fall 2021

*Note: this syllabus draft was last edited September 19, 2021. It was never fully finalized because the course had no enrollment -- it was the first quarter back on campus in person, and there was no way to advertise with the equivalent of posters in the hallways. So this version of the class never ran. It did become the foundation for the second iteration of the class in winter 2024.*

## Introduction

Every single person you encounter -- every instructor, every classmate, every campus worker, every stranger on the bus -- has just been through a life-changing experience during these last 20 months. No one is the same person they were in February 2020 -- not even people for whom this experience has been simply trying rather than traumatic. So many people and institutions are eager to get "back to normal", but things are rarely so simple.

In this class, we'll be learning about project management. Project management is more than a set of processes: doing it well requires you to see and understand networks of relationships and power dynamics. To that end, we'll also be talking about institutions-- primarily the modern US university. How does the university work? How does the university look different to undergrads, grad students, international students, staff of various kinds, and faculty? Who holds power in which contexts, and what other frameworks can one draw upon when collaborating across roles, to ensure everyone's needs are met?

We will watch how these factors play out, and how they intersect with different kinds of pandemic experiences, through engaging in a simulation of an imaginary digital humanities project carried out between March 2020 and February 2021. We will do this in the style of a tabletop role-playing game. Each student will get to create their own character to play over the course of the quarter, and students will get to make choices about how that character lives and works over the course of the imaginary year. How successful each character is in achieving their own goals and working towards completing the imaginary DH project will depend on a combination of your choices, constraints imposed by the pandemic and other real-world events of 2020-2021, and luck as determined by rolling dice.

Learning about project management works best when it's meaningful. Over the course of the quarter, you'll be working on a set of project management plans and tasks for a project that you care about. It can be imaginary (preparing a grant application for your dream project or product) or real (finishing a dissertation, applying for jobs, engaging in activism). Whether or not you carry out the plan in real life, the experience of going through the steps of project planning will make it less daunting to do the same if you ever find yourself in a position where lightweight project management skills are useful.

## Grading

This course will be offered for between 3-5 credits, and for either a grade or credit/no credit. Students who wish to take it as part of the DH Minor must choose 5 credits and must take it for a letter grade.

The course will use contract grading, where students choose what grade they wish to receive, and write a contract (within defined parameters) at the beginning of the quarter that lays out the requirements for receiving that grade. Individual assignments will receive extensive feedback but will be graded as accept / needs revision. Students will have one week to revise assignments that need revision to fulfill the terms of their contract. If a student is unable to fulfill the terms of their original contract, they will meet with the instructor and sign a new contract for a different grade. Parameters for different level grade contracts for each of the credit levels are included in an appendix to this syllabus.

## COVID addendum

By university policy, this course will be held in person by default. Everyone will be required to show a green "OnSite access" badge on their phone when they enter the classroom, and to wear a mask for the duration of the class. (If students need a break to have a snack or drink outside, we can take a few minutes between the discussion and the RPG-playing components of the class.) Depending on student preferences, we may hold some of the class outside if weather and smoke permit.

Even if you've recently tested negative for COVID, please don't come to class if you're feeling unwell. In lieu of participating in the in-class discussion, you can send the instructor an email with some thoughts on the readings for that course session in order for it to not count as an absence.

The RPG is designed to be resilient even if one or more character(s) stop participating for a month or two of in-game time, but if you'd like to send instructions about what you want your character to be doing during a class session where you'll be absent, just send instructions (specific or general) to the instructor and someone will play your character for you and update the course RPG Google Doc with details.

Because everyone feels overwhelmed sometimes (especially during a pandemic), all students get two no-questions-asked days that they can invoke when they haven't been able to do the readings in advance, or need to miss class (without making up the work for that session) for any reason.

## Week 1: What Just Happened?


### Tuesday, September 21, 2021: Introductions

Who am I? Who are you? Who were we in February 2020? Where do we want to go from here? For the first day of class, we'll get to know one another and cover the basics of how the class, and our simulation of doing a digital humanities project in the first year of COVID-19, will work. We'll also talk about grading contracts and how to prepare yours for Thursday.

### Thursday, September 23, 2021: Roles and Rolls

Due: Grading contract

We'll talk in greater depth about the simulation, and how it models institutional roles. Students will pick their character types. We'll also get started together on character type customization.

## Week 2: The End of the World as We Knew It

### Tuesday, September 28, 2021: Shutdown

Due: Draft character sheet

We'll go over the draft character sheet you've created and make any necessary modifications reflecting your character's situation as of March 2020 when our game begins. We'll also talk about how to pick a project that's meaningful for you as the basis of some of your work for this class, as well as the big-picture "what", "why", and "how" of project management in a DH context.

We'll begin the game, and will probably get through half the characters' March 2020.

### Thursday, September 30, 2021: Adapting

We'll talk about some of the reasons why people collaborate, the value of charters as a way of defining project boundaries and agreements. We'll also talk through how to adapt some of these more formal charters to projects with fewer collaborators, and when charters don't really make sense. We'll discuss the "waterfall" (planning upfront) project management model, how it differs from the "Agile" model

We'll finish playing through March 2020 and possibly start April 2020.

## Week 10

### Tuesday, November 30, 2021: Wrap-Up

It's always good project management to plan in some buffer time because things often take longer than we plan. This is that day, for catching up on anything we didn't get to in the discussion or simulation.

### Thursday, December 2, 2021: Benediction

We'll talk about what we learned this quarter and will wrap up class with a special academic tarot reading from the Visionary Futures Collective.

### Friday, December 10th

All remaining work due, including "Project obstacles" response for your own project.
