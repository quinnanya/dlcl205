Project Management and Ethical Collaboration for Humanists
Quinn Dombrowski, DLCL ATS
Winter 2020

**Overview**

Traditional humanities scholarship is typically a solitary endeavor, with an individual scholar attempting to derive insight from complex primary and secondary sources, using their own mind and research skills. Digital humanities scholarship and similar work within and outside academia (e.g. data journalism; libraries, museum, and archive projects; non-profit project management) is usually structured very differently, drawing on the distinct skill sets of individuals within a team. Teams can be complicated, not least because the participants may have very different goals or motivations for being involved. What does it look like to manage a collaborative project in a way that's both effective and ethical, taking into account the needs of people as well as the task? This class will cover project management and collaboration as they are practiced in digital humanities, "alt-ac" (alternative academic) jobs, and similar environments outside academia. In addition to readings and discussion, students will participate in a simulation of one year in the life of a digital humanities project (in the style of *Dungeons and Dragons* and similar role-playing games), with each student playing the role of a member on the project team.

**Credits / Grading**

This course will be offered for between 3-5 credits, and for either a grade or credit/no credit. Students who wish to take it as part of the DH Minor must choose 5 credits (if taken as a core course) or 3 credits (if taken as an elective) and must take it for a letter grade.

The course will use contract grading, where students choose what grade they wish to receive, and write a contract (within defined parameters) at the beginning of the quarter that lays out the requirements for receiving that grade. Individual assignments will receive extensive feedback but will be graded as accept / needs revision. Students will have one week to revise assignments that need revision to fulfill the terms of their contract. If a student is unable to fulfill the terms of their original contract, they will meet with the instructor and sign a new contract for a different grade. Parameters for different level grade contracts for each of the credit levels are included an appendix to this syllabus.

**Assignments**

*Readings*

In this course, you will primarily be reading a mix of typical "gray literature": things outside traditional academic monographs or articles. These include blog posts, white papers, reports, guides, tweets, and similar media that are commonly used to share information about how people actually go about the work of doing projects. While the word count of these readings may be less than you're used to, they are written in a different style than what you may have encountered before, and may take more work to understand, at least at first. We'll be discussing the readings at the beginning of class.

*Responses*

During each run of the simulation, you'll need to complete a certain number of short responses, depending on what you've put in your contract. These responses should briefly (in a few sentences for each question) answer the following questions for the character you are playing, and for another character:

1) How is the project going from the character's perspective? Why do they think that?

2) What is the character worried about most right now? (It doesn't have to be related to the project.) Why?

3) What is one thing that the character would most like another character to do?

*Hands-on activities*

While the simulation will be conducted using our imaginations (with some support from paper, pencil, and dice), the project at the core of the simulation is based on a real one. You can substitute up to 2 responses (or up to 3 responses for 5-credit students) with attending a hands-on activity session, where you'll actually try out some of the steps involved in the work your character may be doing. (You may think twice about making your character proofread digitized text for a month after you've done some yourself.)

Hands-on activities will happen before class (12:30-1:20) on the following Thursdays:

- 1/16: Scanning & OCR

- 1/23: Data wrangling

- 1/30: Text analysis

- 2/6: Publicity

*Simulation reflection*

After we finish the first round of the simulation, you'll have a week to write up a short "white paper" (in the style of the NEH grant white papers) from the perspective of the PI, reporting on the grant outcomes and reflecting on how the project succeeded and where it struggled.

If you'd prefer to write from the perspective of multiple characters, you can split the word count for your credit level between two different pieces: a white paper from the PI's perspective, and some other document applicable to another character's life circumstances. (How would an undergrad present their work on this project as part of a portfolio? How would a grad student incorporate this into a job application? How would the librarian present their work in an annual performance review?)

*Final written project*

For your final assignment (5 credit students), you will prepare a full draft of a grant proposal for the National Endowment for the Humanities Office of Digital Humanities, as part of their [Advancing Digital Humanities grant program](https://www.neh.gov/grants/odh/digital-humanities-advancement-grants). The proposal will follow the actual grant guidelines, including an explanation about the disciplinary impact of the project, environmental scan, history of the project, work plan, final products and dissemination, full budget, budget justification, data management plan, sustainability plan, and letters of support. A document with similar scope and complexity in another context (e.g. non-profit or business) is also an option -- include this in your contract and you can work out the details with Quinn.

Students taking the course for 3 credits can write a partial NEH grant submission (or equivalent in another context) with 6 of the 10 specified components. Three of the components must be the work plan, budget, and data management plan.

**Tuesday, January 7: Introductions**

On the first day, we'll introduce ourselves and discuss digital humanities, alt-ac and non-academic careers, and the role of collaboration and project management in all of these. We'll also talk about the DH project simulation.

**Homework:**

- Watch "[How Do You Play a Tabletop RPG?](https://youtu.be/h-R3ya74TE0)" from Roll20 (YouTube video, 2 min)

- Read "[Introduction to Roleplaying Games](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/michigan-tabletop-gaming-club/learn/introduction-to-roleplaying-games)" from Michigan Tabletop Gaming Club (blog post)

- Read one-page handout "Getting Started with the DH RPG" (on Canvas)

**Thursday, January 9: Professional roles, project roles**

We'll cover the kinds of people who are often involved with digital humanities projects, what their respective "jobs" typically are within an institution, and how those jobs intersect with their roles in projects.

*Simulation:* We'll talk about the project we'll use for the simulation, and students will choose their character types and develop their character sheet.

*Homework:*

- Prepare your character sheet, consulting the DH RPG Skills Guide and example character sheets (Canvas)

**Tuesday, January 14: Lifecycle of a project**

At a high level, we'll cover the development lifecycle of a digital humanities project, also drawing on examples from alt-ac and non-academic contexts.

*Simulation:* We'll go over your draft character sheets, and start the simulation, playing month 1 (June) of the project.

**Hands-on activity: Scanning and OCR (1/16 12:30-1:20, meet in Green Library Bing Wing entrance)**

We'll head behind the scenes to try out the kind of large flatbed scanner that often gets used for DIY DH digitization, and see how long it takes to scan an issue of *Ostrov*. Then, we'll use ABBYY FineReader to OCR it, and see what sort of problems we encounter.

**Thursday, January 16: Data management, archiving, and sustainability**

Once you have digital "stuff" for your project, what do you do with it? What happens when your project is "done" -- or you're done with it? We'll talk about what sustainability looks like for DH and similar projects, and movements towards thinking about data management in digital humanities. We'll also have a special guest presentation by Dinah Handel (from Stanford University Library's Digital Library Systems and Services group) about how digitization actually happens, and what it's like from the library side to collaborate with researchers.

*Simulation:* In the simulation, we'll play months 2 and 3 (July-August).

**Tuesday, January 21: Collaboration, power, and labor**

Digital humanities projects are labor-intensive undertakings. We'll talk about the role of power in collaboration, and discuss how to implement projects in an ethical way with respect to collaborators with varying amounts of power. The materials that your project is working with may raise other important questions around ethics and power, especially when collaborating with minoritized or vulnerable communities. How can you navigate the requirements of grant funding, the expectations of your institutional context, and the needs and interests of the communities you're working with? When is it better to *not* do a project?

*Simulation:* We'll play months 4 and 5 (September-October).

**Hands-on activity: Data wrangling (1/23 12:30-1:20, meet in Green Library Bing Wing entrance)**

We'll go from a plain text export from ABBYY FineReader to the kinds of files (and metadata) that we'll need for computational text analysis.

**Thursday, January 23: Managing people**

People are more than a means to completing a project. Depending on your role and the structure of an organization, a good manager in an alt-ac or non-academic can make the difference between a job you love and a job you hate. Scholars who find themselves in the position of managing people may not realize how much an impact they can have on a person's life -- for both good and ill. We can't cover everything about managing people in one class session, but we'll talk about some big-picture ideas relevant to management, and the ways that the mythos around certain kinds of jobs can perpetuate negative workplace dynamics.

*Simulation:* We'll play months 6 and 7 (November-December).

**Tuesday, January 28: Project management**

What *is* project management, what does it involve, and when are some of the common practices more hassle than they're worth? We'll talk about what project management looks like in practice.

**Hands-on activity: Text analysis (1/30 12:30-1:20, meet in Green Library Bing Wing entrance)**

We'll go from a plain text export from ABBYY FineReader to the kinds of files (and metadata) that we'd need for computational text analysis.

**Thursday, January 30: Social media, publication, and outreach**

If a digital humanities project gets created through a great deal of labor, but no one knows it exists, did it make the best use of its grant funds? We'll talk about both the how and the *why* of getting the word out about digital humanities and similar projects, and the (unevenly distributed) risks and rewards associated with engaging with social media.

Ed. Elizabeth Losh and Jacqueline Wernimont. 2018.

*Simulation:* We'll play months 10 and 11 (March -- April).

**Tuesday, February 4: Organizational politics and other things you can't control**

What are the roles of department chairs, deans, provosts, and presidents with regard to DH work? In a library, museum, or archive context, how do you build alliances within and outside the formal hierarchies of your organization? Scholars often dismiss managing institutional politics as a pointless distraction from research, but it can make the difference between success and failure for a collaborative project. We'll also talk about the similarities and differences in managing organizational politics in business-oriented contexts.

*Simulation:* We'll play month 12 (May).

**Thursday, February 6: Tenure and promotion and alternatives, and taking stock**

We'll talk about how digital humanities projects intersect with tenure and promotion for faculty, and how working on similar projects can influence (or not) promotion and raises for people on alt-ac career paths and outside academia.

*Simulation:* We'll talk about how the first round of the simulation went, and what changes we'd make next time. We'll discuss what you still feel like you need to learn more about for it to go better, and adjust the syllabus accordingly. We'll also talk about the project white paper assignment.

**Hands-on activity: Publicity (2/6 12:30-1:20, meet in Green Library Bing Wing entrance)**

How well can you craft a compelling message that fits in 280 characters? How do you figure out who to email to get the word out? We'll work through how you might actually go about publicizing a project (our RPG project, and/or another idea you'd be interested in doing yourself.)

**Tuesday, February 11: Grants and how to get them**

Grants are a major way that projects get funded in digital humanities and gallery/library/archive/museums, but most people don't know a lot about them before they start applying for them. We'll talk about the kinds of funders, why grants exist, and how they work, along with example grants in a few different contexts. We'll also cover the organizations on campus that you have to get familiar with when writing a grant.

*Simulation:* We'll play months 1 and 2 (June -- July) of the second round of the simulation.

**Thursday, February 13: Budgeting as an act of imagination**

How do you start to figure out how much a project is going to cost? While there are certain kinds of costs that you should plan on (including some tax-like costs from the university itself), much of the budgeting process for any project involves imagination, and just the right amount of pessimism. We'll work through how one might budget for our RPG project.

*Simulation:* We'll play months 3 and 4 (August -- September) of the second round of the simulation.

**Friday, February 14:** Project white paper due

**Tuesday, February 18: Project management vs. managing people**

We'll talk about the ways that managing people and managing projects intersect with and influence one another, and how to navigate the needs of people in the context of projects with their own set of demands.

*Simulation:* We'll play months 5 and 6 (October -- November) of the second round of the simulation.

**Thursday, February 20: Project management: tools and techniques**

We'll cover commonly-used jargon and techniques for project management, including timelines, milestones, and task management. We'll create a RACI matrix and a Gantt chart, and cover the highlights of waterfall vs. agile project management. We'll also touch on some of the many tools for implementing project management.

*Readings:*

- Claire Drumond. "[Is the Agile Manifesto still a thing?](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/manifesto)" Atlassian Agile Coach.

*Simulation:* We'll play months 7 and 8 (December -- January) of the second round of the simulation.

**Tuesday, February 25: People management: tools and techniques**

What makes for a good work environment? How do you make a project be more than a source of income, but something that can support people in working towards where they want to be in their careers -- whatever that path is? How do you manage conflict within groups, and support people through change? You'll get a crash course in current approaches to managing people.

*Readings:*

- Excerpts from UC Berkeley "KEYS -- Keys to Your Supervisory Success" handouts (Canvas)

*Simulation:* We'll play months 9 and 10 (February -- March) of the second round of the simulation.

**Thursday, February 27: First-person perspectives in alt-ac and beyond**

We'll have a set of guest presentations (virtual and in-person) from people with a background in digital humanities, who've gone to work in a range of alt-ac, non-profit, and corporate positions.

*Readings:*

*Simulation:* On hiatus

**Tuesday, March 3: Agreements and commitments**

Sometimes it's helpful -- or necessary -- to formalize agreements, understandings, and commitments through written documents. We'll talk about project charters, data sharing agreements, and MOUs, and the roles they play in these kinds of projects.

*Readings:*

- Stanford Digital Repository Service Level Agreement and other examples of common kinds of agreement documents (Canvas)

*Simulation:* We'll play months 11 and 12 (April -- May) of the second round of the simulation.

**Thursday, March 5: Project endings**

Most DH and similar projects need ongoing attention -- in terms of technical maintenance, content updates, and other things that require human labor -- if they are going to continue to thrive. But what happens when you're done with a project and want to walk away? Consciously ending a project also takes work, but without deliberate action to end it, it may linger in a zombified state. We'll talk about how to end projects well, considering the many people who have a stake in the project.

**Tuesday, March 10: Wrap-up and placeholder**

In reality, this class isn't going to work out as neatly as I'm planning. There'll be unanswered questions, things people want to know more about, and the simulation may run longer than expected. We'll wrap up any loose ends in this class (including the second round of the simulation).

**Thursday, March 12: What have we learned?**

Considering the totality of the topics we've covered, both iterations of the simulation, and the final projects, what can you take away from this class, and how can you apply it to future careers -- academic and non-academic? We'll talk about some concrete steps you can take, including things you can add to your resume or CV, to reflect what you've learned in the class.

**Accommodations**

I want this class to be accessible to anyone who shows up with an interest in the topic. Everyone has a right to the full experience of the class --- which is fundamentally about how to work with other people to accomplish things you all find valuable. Odds are, you'll have to do it someday, within or outside the academy. Grappling with your identity as a student and/or scholar can be difficult, especially when the topic at hand is *what happens next* in your life and career. If there's something in the syllabus or that we cover in class that freaks you out, please talk to me! If you're encountering a barrier, or expecting a possible barrier to your being able to successfully complete your contract, let's chat! It doesn't need to be academic --- sleep-training kids, taking care of unwell family and friends, roommates who listen to Viking metal bands at full volume at all hours of the night, and anxiously binge-watching Netflix are real life. Mental illness flare-ups can impact what you can get done --- I know, I had a bipolar II diagnosis for all of grad school. Whether or not you've got paperwork through the Office of Accessible Education (<https://oae.stanford.edu/>), please come talk to me anytime if something is getting in the way of your learning or completing the contract you created.

**Fundamental standard & honor code**

Beyond the bare minimums laid out by the Stanford Fundamental Standard (<https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/fundamental-standard>), I expect you to treat one another in this class not only with respect, but with generosity. If you find a resource or an approach that has helped you, share it so others can benefit -- and listen when others share.

The honor code (<https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/honor-code>) lays out guidelines for the university's policy on academic integrity.

Students will write their own contracts for the grade they want to receive, using the parameters below. The contract allows students to set their own goals for how much they want to invest in this class, and hold themselves accountable for it. Because of the requirements of university degree programs, contracts have to map to grades, but that shouldn't get in the way of students' goals or learning. There is some overlap in the parameters for different grades at different credit levels; a student taking this course for 3 credits who wants to focus on this class may end up putting in as much work for their A as a student taking it for 5 credits who has other priorities this quarter. This is "a feature, not a bug", as is said about software: the 3-credit student will have a structure to hold themselves accountable for engaging with the class to the extent they want, and the 5-credit student will do enough work to get their desired grade given the university's expectations of how much work should go into that grade at that credit level.

With contract grading, individual assignments get feedback and comments, but aren't given a letter grade. Assignments are evaluated as either "accepted" or "needs revisions". (Don't stress about an assignment needing revisions -- in reality, most things *do* need revisions!) You'll have a week to revise the assignment and re-submit it; for the final assignment, you'll have as much time as there is left before grades are due.
